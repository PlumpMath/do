# do it!

A simple, non-mutable todo list. The datasource is a list of objects
with a description and status, in JSON.

## Why?

To make me do things I've put off for too long. In public, for others to
see, so they can ask me about it, help me and whatnot.

## The future

* indicate the age of the items (probably sort by it, but preferrably
    show it as a color)
    - what color should finished items have?
* be prettier
* explain on the page, invite readers to help
* send links to friends (or other trusted/interesting people)
