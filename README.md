# do it!

A simple, non-mutable todo list. The datasource is a list of objects
with a description and status, in JSON.

## Why?

To make me do things I've put off for too long. In public, for others to
see, so they can ask me about it, help me and whatnot.

## The future

See [todos.json](./todos.json)
